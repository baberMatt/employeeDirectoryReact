Employee Directory

This is a simple app that uses an API to populate a fake employee directory into react components. It does so through using state.
After populating and using utils to assign them a dept and job title, it then sets them to state and uses that to render them into a table.
From there you can sort them, or filter them by dept. Filtering them maps a new array in state so as not to lose the original set of 
employees, this is due to the lack of the employees being stored data, as that was not a req. of this assignment. Firing all of them simple
reloads the page, which mounts the component again thus rendering 10 new employees. 

Thanks for checking out my app,
